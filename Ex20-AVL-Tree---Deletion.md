# Ex20 AVL Tree - Deletion
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C function to delete an element from an AVL Tree.
## Algorithm
1. Search for the node to delete starting from the root. 
2. Delete the node using standard BST rules. 
3. Update the height of the affected nodes. 
4. Calculate the balance factor of each updated node. 
5. Perform rotations if the node is unbalanced. 
6. Continue until the tree is balanced again.
7. 
## Program:
```

node * Delete(node *T,int x) 
{ 
node *p; 
if(T==NULL) 
{ 
return NULL; 
} 
else 
if(x > T->data) // insert in right subtree 
{ 
T->right=Delete(T->right,x); 
if(BF(T)==2) 
{ 
if(BF(T->left)>=0) 
T=LL(T); 
else 
T=LR(T); 
}} 
else 
if(x<T->data) 
{ 
T->left=Delete(T->left,x); 
if(BF(T)==-2) //Rebalance during windup 
{ 
if(BF(T->right)<=0) 
T=RR(T); 
else 
T=RL(T); 
}} 
else 
  
  
{ 
//data to be deleted is found 
if(T->right!=NULL) 
{ //delete its inorder succesor 
p=T->right; 
while(p->left!= NULL) 
p=p->left; 
T->data=p->data; 
T->right=Delete(T->right,p->data); 
if(BF(T)==2)//Rebalance during windup 
{ 
if(BF(T->left)>=0) 
T=LL(T); 
else 
T=LR(T);}} 
else 
return(T->left); 
} 
T->ht=height(T); 
return(T); 
} 
```

## Result:

Thus, the C program to delete an element from an AVL Tree is implemented successfully.
